              <p>Hello!
                I am Kelly Fam, and I study Computer Science at Cornell University. <br/> <br/>
                I enjoy creating innovative applications and researching cutting edge technology. I have experience with Python, Java, and Swift and have coded in C, C#, HTML, CSS, PHP, and <a href="pdf/resume.pdf">more</a>.
  </br></br>
                Last summer, I worked at <a href="https://www.squarespace.com/">Squarespace</a> as a Frontend Software Engineering Intern, working on making customizable System Pages (404, Search, Locked Pages)
                for their newest version!
              </br></br>
                Previously, I worked with <a href="https://www.ainfosec.com/">Assured Information Security Inc.</a> for the past two summers. The first year I worked under a Senior Scientist of the United
                States Air Force, to research the restructuring of the Command and Control of the GPS, along with the <a href="pdf/blockchains.pdf">potential use of blockchains</a> in the Air Force.
                The second year I participated in the United States Air Force Research Lab's Advanced Course in Engineering and gained valuable experience on cyber tactics and network infrastructure
                while also being able to participate in cyber warfare with a Capture the Flag Attack/Defend hack-fest.

                <p>
                  During my summer at <a href="https://www.ainfosec.com/">AIS</a>, I was tasked with researching the current Command and Control
                  of the Global Positioning System (GPS). In my research, I was introduced to blockchains. Soon after,
                  my collegue and I wrote a <a href="pdf/blockchains.pdf">paper</a> to the Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force on the potential applications of
                  blockchains in the Air Force, honing blockchains'of data validation and virtual ledgers. We were asked to write a follow-up
                  report on the latest <a href="pdf/redbellybc.pdf">Red Belly Blockchain technology</a> and its potential in the Air Force.
                  <br/><br/>
                  Afterwards, I reaccessed the possibility of blockchains in the Command and Control of the GPS. Instead of a
                  typical centralization involving the Master Control System (MCS), my collegue and I created a simulation
                  of a GPS Command and Control that was decentralized. It was a table-top demonstration that included a Javascript Front-End
                  and a Python backend. Blockchains can easily be implemented in our Python backend.

                During the fall of 2017, I took an Introduction to Web Design class and an Introduction to IOS Development class.
                <br/><br/>
                <h4>Introduction to Web Design</h4>
                <p>We focused on static websites in this class using HTML, CSS and PHP. The two websites below were both
                  projects in my web design class. The first being a website with forms about the annual Ithaca
                  Apple Festival in an effort to get users to become a part of the Ithaca tradition. The second is a website
                  for a client from Cornell, a dance group who wants to promote their events, members and auditions through
                  the world wide web. The third is a website using bootstrap and sass, different from the other two.

                            <h4>Data-Driven Applications</h4>
                            Throughout this course, we learned to manipulate large quanities of information in comma-separated values, JSON, and other formats to
                            create graphs that demonstrated relationships between different correlated information. We used Javascript and the D3 library to create
                            static and dynamic interactive visualizions for web browsers.

                                      The first visualization needed to be a static visualization of any topic, but must offer a complex message based on multiple sets of data.
                                      I used data sets from Kaggle that held information about numerous gun shootings in the United States dating back to 50 years ago. I used this
                                      and a data set of the United States to display the locations of the shootings on the United States map. With this in mind, I had each
                                      representation of a shooting show the ratio of the fatalities verus the victims with the ring size of each donut shaped ring on the map. In addition,
                                      I used a sunburst graph to show the correlation between race and cause. I found that for mass shootings caused by terrorism, it was several races, with
                                      Caucasians reigning in at least 40% of the terrorist caused shootings. </p>

                                        <p>
                                          The second visualization needed to be interactive, and similar to the first project, convey a complex message about the topic for the users to
                                          take back with them. I chose California Wildfires as the theme for this project. I used a very large dataset that held information about California
                                          wildfires from about 1992 to 2009. The data set provided information about the cause of the wildfire, how far it spread, the name of the wildfire, and
                                          where in particular the wildfire started. The first part of this visualiation was a map of Califoria with circles to represent each wildfire.
                                          The size of the circle represented how large the fire spread. I also used color to differentiate between fire sizes. The map comes with a few
                                          interactive features, such as a click to zoom in and out, and a way to filter by causes. This allowed users to make connections between location and
                                          causes, as well as a way to get a closer look at the different wildfires as there were many. The second part of this visualization was a bipartite graph
                                          used to demonstrate the perecentages of wildfires affiliated with a particular cause either over the years or in one specific year. This was the interactive
                                          feature of the bipartitie graph as seen in the video on the left. </p>

                                    <h4>Principals of Backend Engineering</h4>
                                    <p>In this class, I learned the importance of backend development to support applications, varying from mobile applications to web applications.
                                      Our assignments comprised of creating a backend, using this backend to create an API for a web application, and deploying this web application
                                      through Amazon Web Services. I learned to use tools like httpie, vagrant, JSON, gunicorn, nginx, ansible, terraform, and more. I followed a
                                      model view controller architecture and created data access objects.
                                      <br/><br/>
                                      <h4>Functional Programming using OCaml</h4>
                                      <p>I completed a series of assignments that focuses on functional programming, where we use immutable data types and avoid changing states.
                                        A few assignments included a text-adventure game, an interpreter for Jocalf, and a search engine. For the final project, I was in a group where
                                        we had to implement a game with a graphical user inteface (GUI).
                                      </p>

                                      <p>The game was based off the real-life game Not Alone. We attempted to make the game as true to the actual game as possible. The features include a
                                        multiplayer team turn-based card game, it supports up to four players, the alien is AI-controlled, with simple and complex AI logic (easy/hard alien modes),
                                        and a GUI interface to display the game board. </p>

                                        This 10 week long intensive cyber security boot camp comprised of three distinct parts: weekly challenges, research, tradecrafts, and network administrative challenges.
                                        This program is under the United States Air Force Research Lab (AFRL) and AIS. Over these ten weeks, I became experienced with UNIX and Powershell.

                                        <br/><br/>
                                        <h4>Weekly Challenges</h4>
                                        Every week, we were introduced to a new topic, attended a day lecture on this topic, and was given a challenge problem related to the topic on hand.
                                        After each week, we had to present on our solution and write a 10+ page paper on the solution.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        <h6>Week 1: Systems Requirements Specifications</h6>
                                        I was tasked with writing a proper System Requirements Specification paper for my research.
                                        A System Requirements Specification is important to any sort of development. It allows developers
                                        to pinpoint and orient their goals and objectives for a specific project. It focuses on the scope
                                        of the project, the purpose of the project, the intended users of the project, and the functional
                                        and non-functional requirements of the project. It heavily emphasizes use cases for the project.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        <h6>Week 2: Concept of Operations</h6>
                                        I was tasked with creating a concept of operations for Air Force missions. The solution is based on
                                        the doctine <i> Joint Publication 3-50 Personnel Recovery </i>.  I utilized the System-Theoretic
                                        Process Analysis (STPA) of System-Theoretic and Technical Operational Management (STORM). The solution
                                        required access control logic.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        <h6>Week 3: Secure Enclave Design</h6>
                                        The weekly challenge of this week involved infiltrating and finding sensitive information through a network.
                                        This required the use of a reverse shell which allowed us to perform command injection. We had to infiltrate
                                        three target machines with each target machine holding a unique circumstance that we must take into consideration
                                        when gaining access to each machine. For example, one machine only allowed access through port 443.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        <h6>Week 4: Network Reconnassiance</h6>
                                        This weekly challenge was similar to the previous week in that we had to infiltrate a network for sensitive information.
                                        We were only provided an IP address and a port number.
                                        This network was connected to a few other networks that we had to access through the esclation of privleges.
                                        I performed active and passive network reconnaissance and found different domains. I used tools such as a Remote Desktop
                                        Protocol (RDP), command injection, Hot Potato, John the Ripper, OpenVPN, PsExec, PuTTy, SOCKS5 proxy, SSH tunneling, and Nmap to
                                        complete this challenge.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        <h6>Week 6: Bypassing Network Defenses</h6>
                                        This week, I had to infiltrate three difference target machines that had different network defenses. It varied from
                                        anti-virus to firewalls to Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). The solution required Metasploit and Magic Unicorn to
                                        generate a payload that the victim machine would run that allowed to perform command injection. I created a
                                        test environment to run the test payload on in VMWare Workstation. The test enviornment consisted of three Window 10
                                        machines, a Vyos Router, and a Snort IDS.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        <h6>Week 7: Code-Level Vulnerabilities</h6>
                                        We were given four programs to expose their vulnerabilties with memory leaks, stack smashing and buffer overflow.
                                        I had to consider possible preventive measures such as Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) and canary values.
                                        I exploited these vulnerabilites through the anaylsis of the arbitrary C code, and then performed a memory leak attack,
                                        buffer overflow attack, and a stack smashing attack which I had it run a remote shell on a port of my choice.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        <h6>Week 8: Reverse Engineering and Malware Anaylsis</h6>
                                        We were given malware to anaylize its static and dynamic effects on a victim machine. I used tools such as WhatIsRunning,
                                        RegShot, Procmon, Lord PE, PEid, OllyDbg, Ida Pro, FakeDNS, HWxD to perform static and dynamic anaylsis. I had to complete
                                        an overview of what the malware did in terms of the packer used, the DLLs created/modified, and significant registry key
                                        creations/modifications.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        <h6>Week 9: Wireless Fundamentals</h6>
                                        We were given a scenerio where we had to intercept packets between a web server and a user and perform ARP poisoning. We had to
                                        modify the website without the owner of the web server knowing. I used ettercap and its filtering abilities to modify the
                                        website in wireless transit.
                                        <br/><br/>

                                        <h4>Research</h4>
                                        The overall point of my research project was to provide a visual aid to Red Teams. I created a GUI with PyQt4. The
                                        features of the GUI involved filtering and accessing different host machine specifications.
                                        <br/><br/>

                                        <h4>Tradecrafts</h4>
                                        I attended a tradecraft every week that had relevance to the topic of the week. Tradecrafts included generating phishing e-mails,
                                        infilitrating SCADA machines with the modification of payloads, using Metasploit and Venom to generate a callback on machines, and
                                        performing an out-of-order execution and speculation attack.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        <h4>Network Administrative Challenges</h4>
                                        Over the course of the ten weeks, we had to complete weekly network challenge problems. This included creating a router for
                                        a network intended for use in Capstone.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        <h5>Capstone</h5>
                                        This was a final hack-fest that followed an attack and defend capture the flag scenerio. It was a similated cyber war between two
                                        arbitrary countries. We had to use cyber tactics to infilitrate enemy Site-to-Missle (SAM) sites while also hindering the opposing
                                        team's networks and defending our own networks.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        <h5>Services</h5>
                                        The services we had to create within our subnetworks were: a HTTP/HTTPS web server, Telnet server, IRC server, SSH server,
                                        a relational database server, FTP server, SMTP server, DNS server, Gitlab server, VPN server, and a Vyos router on server virtualization
                                        software.

                                        <p>During the spring of 2019, I took a class made sense of the vast amounts of information available online,
                                        and how to relate it and to the social context in which it appears. This course introduces basic tools for
                                        retrieving and analyzing unstructured textual infordia. Applications include information retrieval
                                        (with human feedback), sentiment analysis and social analysis of text.</p>
